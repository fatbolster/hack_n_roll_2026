        "marks": 5,
        "answer_key": "1 mark for explaining that scientific theories are subject to change; 1 mark for mentioning that new evidence can challenge existing theories; 1 mark for the reliability and durability of established scientific knowledge; 2 marks for providing a specific example (e.g., the transition from Newtonian physics to Einstein's theory of relativity, or changes in health guidelines based on new research)."

        "marks": 5,
        "answer_key": "1 mark for describing the arrangement of particles in solids (closely packed in a fixed position). 1 mark for describing movement in solids (vibrating in fixed positions). 1 mark for describing arrangement in liquids (closely packed but able to move past each other). 1 mark for describing movement in liquids (flowing and taking the shape of the container). 1 mark for describing the arrangement in gases (far apart and random). 1 mark for describing movement in gases (high energy, moving freely and rapidly). 1 mark for linking particle movement to kinetic energy (particles in gases have higher kinetic energy than those in solids)."

        "marks": 5,
        "answer_key": "1 mark for stating that sodium donates one electron to become Na+; 1 mark for stating that chlorine accepts one electron to become Cl-; 1 mark for describing the formation of ions; 1 mark for mentioning that the oppositely charged ions attract each other; 1 mark for correctly stating that the resulting compound is sodium chloride (NaCl)."

        "marks": 5,
        "answer_key": "Let the width be x cm. Then, the length is 2x cm. Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(2x + x) = 6x. Setting the perimeter to 48 cm, we have 6x = 48. Therefore, x = 8 cm. The width is 8 cm and the length is 16 cm. The area = length \u00d7 width = 16 cm \u00d7 8 cm = 128 cm\u00b2."

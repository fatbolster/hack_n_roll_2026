(b) 3 workers can paint the court in 5 days. After painting the first day, the workers had to 
stop on the second and third day because it was raining. 
Teachers, Mr Chin and Mr Lee, decided to help with the painting on the fourth and fifth 
day. 
Assuming the 3 workers and 2 teachers paint at the same rate, can they finish painting the 
shaded area on the fifth day?

Dorothy wants to make a bracelet using gemstones. Every gemstone is a regular 
pentagon of the same size. 
  
 
 
How many gemstones does she need to make a bracelet  
assuming that there is no gap between each gemstone? 
 
 
 
 
Interior angle of each pentagon = 
(5−2)

× 180° = 108°         [M1]                            
 
        So interior angle of polygon inside = 360° −108° −108° = 144°          [M1] 
                    ∴

𝑛= 36°

Each term in the following sequence is found by multiplying the same constant to the 
previous term.

The diagram below shows a school Tchoukball court of dimension 27m by 16m. On each end is 
a semicircle of radius 3m. The shaded part is to be painted yellow.        
 
                 
 
                                                                    
 
 
(a)

(b) 3 workers can paint the court in 5 days. After painting the first day, the workers had to 
stop on the second and third day because it was raining. 
Teachers, Mr Chin and Mr Lee, decided to help with the painting on the fourth and fifth 
day. 
Assuming the 3 workers and 2 teachers paint at the same rate, can they finish painting the 
shaded area on the fifth day? 
Show your working clearly.  
 
 
 
Man-days needed to paint the court  
= 5 x 3 
= 15 …………………. M1 
 
 
Man-days needed after the first day 
= 15 – (3 x 1) 
= 12  
 
 
Number of people needed for the fourth and fifth days 
= 12 ÷ 2 
= 6 …………………. M1 
 
 
Number of workers and teachers painting on the fourth and fifth days  
 = 5 
 
Therefore, they cannot finish painting on the fifth day.

In the diagram, ∠𝐴𝐵𝐷=  ∠𝐶𝐵𝐷 and ∠𝐵𝐴𝐷= ∠𝐵𝐶𝐷.  
Prove that ∆𝐴𝐵𝐷 and ∆𝐶𝐵𝐷 are congruent.

(b) In the diagram below, O is the centre of the circle and BDG is a straight line. PQ is a 
tangent to the circles at A and H respectively. ∠𝐴𝐵𝐷= 270 and ∠𝐷𝐸𝐹= 1530.

Ben wants to work as a food delivery rider (Bicycle) during the one-month school 
holiday. He is choosing between two companies – Get Food and Food Pack. 
 
Ben wants to work 5 days a week, during non-peak hours. He can make an average 
of 6 deliveries a day during non-peak hours. Ben does not own a bicycle.  
Assuming that he makes three late deliveries in one month, how much does he earn 
in that month if he works with Get Food and Food Pack?  
 
Get Food 
 
Revenue 
= (5 x 6 x 4 x $5.50) + (9 x $10) 
= $750 ……………………………….. M1  
 
Earnings 
= $750 - $72 - $19.90 ………………...M1 
= $658.10 …………………………… A1 
 
 
 
Food Pack 
 
Revenue 
= (5 x 6 x 4 x $6)  
= $720 ……………………………….. M1  
 
Earnings 
= $720 - $50 – (3 x $1.50) ………………...M1

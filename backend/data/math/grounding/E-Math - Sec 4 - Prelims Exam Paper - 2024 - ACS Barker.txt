On a particular day in 2023, the exchange rate between Singapore dollars (SGD) and 
United States dollars (USD) was USD 1 = SGD x. 
 
 
 
(a) 
Write down an expression, in terms of x, for the USD received in exchange for 
SGD 10 000.  
 
 
 
 
Answer  USD = ___________________ 
[1] 
 
  
 
 
In 2022, the rate was such that USD 1 would exchange for SGD 0.030 less than in 2023. 
The difference in exchanging SGD 10 000 in 2023 and SGD 10 000 in 2022, is USD 166.

Lee has savings of $105 000.  
With his savings and monthly income, he intends to buy a car, in January 2024.  
He is deciding between buying an EV 60kWh electric car or a 1998cc petrol car. 
 
The table below is used to calculate the cost price of the car: 
 
Car Type 
EV 60kWh electric car 
1998cc petrol car 
a. Base cost (without COE) 
$100,000 
$110,000 
b. COE 
Refer to Table A (COE Prices)  
c. 
Rebates (clean energy initiatives) 
$30,000 
Not applicable 
Total cost price of car = a + b – c  
 
 
 
Every car owner in Singapore must purchase a Certificate of Entitlement (COE) for the car, 
which gives him the right to own and use a vehicle in Singapore. The COE prices since 
January 2023 can be seen below.

(a) 
One possible answer 
• ET = AT (tangents from external points are equal) 
• TO is common  
• OE = OA (radii of circle)  
Triangle TOA is congruent to triangle TOE (SSS test) 
 
 
 
 
Another possible answer 
• angle TAO = angle TEO = 90° (tangent perpendicular to radius) 
• TO is common  
• OE = OA (radii of circle)  
Triangle TOA is congruent to triangle TOE (RHS test) 
 
 
 
 
 
(bi) 
angle AOT = (180 – 90 – 32)° = 58° 
(tangent perpendicular to radius) 
 
 
 
angle ABF = 
1
2angle AOT  
1
2 (58°) = 29° 
(angle at centre is twice angle at circumference) 
 
 
 
angle OFG = angle ABF = 29° 
(alternate angles, OF //BA) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(bii) 
angle ACF = angle ABF =29° 
(angles in the same segment) 
 
 
 
angle CAE = 180 – 90 – 29 = 61° 
(OT is perpendicular bisector of chord AE) 
 
 
 
angle CDE = 180 – 61 = 119° 
(angles in opposite segments) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(c) 
As angle OET and angle OAT are right-angles, by the property of right 
angle in a semicircle, OT is a diameter and points E and A will lie on 
the circumference. OETA are thus four points on the circumference of 
this circle. 
Or 
Angle AOE + angle ATE = (58 × 2) + (32 × 2) = 180° 
Angle OET + angle OAT = 180°. 
By the property of angles in opposite segments, OETA are thus four 
points on the circumference of this circle.

EV 60kWh 
 
 
Cost price of car 
$(100,000+105,000 – 30,000 
=$175,000 
 
 
Minimum downpayment 
40% × $175,000 = $70,000 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1998cc petrol car 
 
 
Cost price of car 
$(110,000+150,000) = $260,000 
 
 
Minimum downpayment 
30% × $260,000 = $78,000 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 months of Lee’s salary 
= 6 × $5000 = $30,000 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Savings – downpayment 
EV 60kWh:  
$(105,000 – 70,000) = $35,000 
1998cc petrol car:  
$(105,000 – 78,000) = $27,000  
 
 
conclusion 
Lee can only afford the downpayment for the EV 60kWh.  
($35,000 – $30,000 = $5000) 
 
 
 
 
 
(c) 
To determine is Lee can afford the car in Jan 2024. 
 
 
i) Road Tax 
[250 + 3.75(60 −30)] × 0.7826 ÷ 6 
= $47.246 
 
 
ii) Loan amount 
175000 – 70000 = $105,000 
 
 
Interest 
105,000×2.78×7
100
= $20,433 
 
 
(iii) Monthly Instalment 
(105,000 + 20,433) ÷ 84 
=$1493.25 
 
 
iv) Other costs (monthly 
basis)  
4700
12 + 600 = $991.667 
 
 
Total monthly expense 
$2532.1625 
 
 
Spare cash for the month 
5000 – 2700 = $2300 
 
 
v) Affordability  
Spare cash – total monthly 
expenses 
2300 – 2532.1625 
= – $232.1625  
Lee would not be able to afford the car. 
 
 
 
However, if we take into consideration that Lee still has 
$5,000 remaining after making the downpayment in part (b), 
with $30,000 already set aside, he would be able to afford 
the car

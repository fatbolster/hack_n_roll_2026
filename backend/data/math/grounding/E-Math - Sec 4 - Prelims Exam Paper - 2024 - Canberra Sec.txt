(b) Jim engaged a driver for 10 hours and his family travelled in a SUV for 
one day during their trip.  
The driver picked them from their accommodation in the city to 
attractions outside the city. 
 
The driver drove the first stage of the journey at an average speed of       
70 km/h.  
The second stage of the journey is 32 km longer than the second stage. 
The driver drove at an average speed of 80 km/h.  
The journey takes a total of 4 hours and 9 minutes.  
 
Fuel price for the vehicle was $1.70 per litre. 
Jim paid $550 to the driver. 
He thinks that he included a 20% tips in the amount paid to the driver.  
 
Is he correct?

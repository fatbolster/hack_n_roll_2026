INTRODUCTION 
 
 
The syllabus is intended to provide students with fundamental mathematical knowledge and skills. The content 
is organised into three strands, namely, Number and Algebra, Geometry and Measurement, and Statistics and 
Probability. Besides conceptual understanding and skill proficiency explicated in the content strands, important 
mathematical processes such as reasoning, communication and application (including the use of models) are 
also emphasised and assessed.  
 
 
 
AIMS 
 
The O-Level Mathematics syllabus aims to enable all students to: 
 
• 
acquire mathematical concepts and skills for continuous learning in mathematics and to support learning in 
other subjects 
 
• 
develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive skills through a mathematical 
approach to problem-solving 
 
• 
connect ideas within mathematics and between mathematics and other subjects through applications of 
mathematics 
 
• 
build confidence and foster interest in mathematics. 
 
 
 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES 
 
The assessment will test candidates’ abilities to: 
 
AO1 
Use and apply standard techniques 
• 
recall and use facts, terminology and notation 
• 
read and use information directly from tables, graphs, diagrams and texts 
• 
carry out routine mathematical procedures  
 
AO2 
Solve problems in a variety of contexts 
• 
interpret information to identify the relevant mathematics concept, rule or formula to use 
• 
translate information from one form to another 
• 
make and use connections across topics/subtopics 
• 
formulate problems into mathematical terms 
• 
analyse and select relevant information and apply appropriate mathematical techniques to solve 
problems 
• 
interpret results in the context of a given problem 
 
AO3  
Reason and communicate mathematically 
• 
justify mathematical statements 
• 
provide explanation in the context of a given problem

NOTES 
 
1. 
Omission of essential working will result in loss of marks. 
 
2. 
Relevant mathematical formulae will be provided for candidates. 
 
3. 
Candidates should also have geometrical instruments with them for both papers.  
 
4. 
Give non-exact numerical answers correct to 3 significant figures, or 1 decimal place in the case of angles 
in degrees, unless a different level of accuracy is specified in the question. In questions which explicitly 
require an answer to be shown to be correct to a specific accuracy, the answer must be first shown to a 
higher degree of accuracy.  
 
5. 
SI units will be used in questions involving mass and measures.  
 
Both the 12-hour and 24-hour clock may be used for quoting times of the day. In the 24-hour clock, for 
example, 3.15 a.m. will be denoted by 03 15; 3.15 p.m. by 15 15.  
 
6. 
Candidates are expected to be familiar with the solidus notation for the expression of compound units,  
e.g. 5 cm/s for 5 centimetres per second, 13.6 g/cm3 for 13.6 grams per cubic centimetre. 
  
7. 
Unless the question requires the answer in terms of π, the calculator value for π or π = 3.142 should be 
used. 
 
8. 
Spaces will be provided in each question paper for working and answers. 
 
 
 
PROBLEMS IN REAL-WORLD CONTEXTS 
 
Notwithstanding the presentation of the topics in 3 separate strands in the syllabus document, it is envisaged 
that some examination questions (including the extended problem involving real-world contexts at the end of 
Paper 2) may integrate ideas from more than one topic.  
 
Problems in real-world contexts may be based on contexts: 
 
• 
In everyday life (including travel/excursion plans, transport schedules, sports and games, recipes, floor 
plans, navigation etc.) 
• 
Involving personal and household finance (including simple and compound interest, taxation, instalments, 
utilities bills, money exchange, etc.) 
 
These problems may also require: 
 
• 
Interpreting and analysing data from tables and graphs, including distance-time and speed-time graphs; 
• 
Interpreting the solution in the context of the problem.
